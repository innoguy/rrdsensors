Analysis:
- Around 9:30 TeamViewer went down (see application view) although nobody logged in to do so (see network view)
- In the system view you can see a lot of disk activity around 9:30, which may be related to the crash
- Around 11:00 TeamViewer came back (see application view) apparently by someone who logged in to the system (see network view)
